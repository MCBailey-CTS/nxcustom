#
#  ROUTING Application Environment Variables
#
#  The Routing Applications are  Routing Electrical, Routing Mechanical,
#  and Routing Logical.
#  The environment variables in this section apply to one or all of
#  these applications.
#
#  Variables that apply to a single application include the name
#  of the application in the variable name.  Variables that apply to
#  all applications have ROUTING or ROUTE in their names.
#
#  The UGII_ROUTE_UGMANAGER_MODE variables specifies if the Routing
#  administrative files should be loaded from Teamcenter or not.  It
#  can have values of TRUE or FALSE.
#
#  If set to TRUE then the Routing administrative files will be loaded
#  from Teamcenter. If FALSE then the default mechanism of looking for
#  these files in the kits or in the directory specified by environment
#  variables will be used.
#
#  The Routing administrative files are loaded upon entering a Routing
#  application.  It consists of the following files:
#       1. Application view         - .xml
#       2. XML Schema file          - .xsd
#       3. Part Library View        - .plv
#       4. Part Tables              - .ptb
#       5. Routing Configuration    - .cfg
#
#  These files will only be searched in one place, i.e. either in
#  Teamcenter or in the kits, based on the value of this variable.
#  An error will be raised if any of these files are not found.
#
#  Additionaly, if this variable is set to TRUE then users who want to
#  select a Routing Harness (.hrn), Routing Component (.cmp) Routing
#  Format (.fmt) or Routing Filter (.flt) file in Routing Electrical
#  will have to do it from Teamcenter.
#
#      UGII_ROUTE_UGMANAGER_MODE      Variable indicating if Routing
#                                     administrative files (.xml, .xsd,
#                                     .plv, etc) should be loaded from
#                                     Teamcenter or not.
#
#  The following variables define the application view file (.apv) for
#  each Routing application.  The variable provides either the file
#  name only or the full path specification.
#
#      UGII_ROUTE_ELEC_APP_VIEW       Electrical APV
#      UGII_ROUTE_MECH_APP_VIEW       Mechanical APV
#      UGII_ROUTE_LGCL_APP_VIEW       Logical APV
#
#  If the APP_VIEW variable specifies only the APV file name, then the
#  APV file must be in the directory specified by the variable
#  UGII_ROUTING_APP_VIEW_DIR.
#
#      UGII_ROUTING_APP_VIEW_DIR      Directory containing APV files
#
# The Part Library View (.plv) file for each application determines the
# part selection hierarchy when using Routing's Place Part.  The APV
# file specifies the PLV file used for a particular application.  If the
# APV file does not provide the complete path specification, then the
# PLV file must reside in one of the directories specified by
# UGII_EPLIB_PART_LIB_VIEW_PATH.
#
#      UGII_EPLIB_PART_LIB_VIEW_PATH  Directory paths of PLV files
#
# Part Table files (.ptb) define Routing Characteristics for parts and
# stock used by Routing.  The PLV file of the application references the
# PTB files.  If the PLV file does not provide the complete file path
# specification of a PTB file, then the PTB file must reside in one of
# the directories specified by UGII_EPLIB_TABLE_PATH.
#
#      UGII_EPLIB_TABLE_PATH          Directory paths of PTB files.
#
# The PTB files reference existing part files, which may be part family
# template parts or individual part files.  Any part referenced by a PTB
# must reside in one of the directories specified by the Part Path
# variable for that application.
#
#      UGII_ROUTE_ELEC_PART_PATH      Electrical Part Path
#      UGII_ROUTE_MECH_PART_PATH      Mechanical Part Path
#      UGII_ROUTE_LGCL_PART_PATH      Logical Part(symbol)Path
#
# If the PTB files reference Part Family template files, then Place Part
# generates the member parts as needed.  Member part files are generated
# in the same directory as those created by standard Part Family unless
# the following variable is defined, which provides the Routing specific
# destination directory.
#
#      UGII_ROUTING_MEMBER_SAVE_DIR   Directory in which Routing creates
#                                     part family members from template
#                                     files during Place Part
#                                     operation (no default value)
#
# Design Rule files (.dr) and TCL files (.tcl)define the design rules
# for each application. Routing locates these files by the following
# variables.
#
#      UGII_ROUTING_DESIGN_RULES_PATH Directory path of all DR files for
#                                     Routing Mechanical/Electrical

#                                     Routing List (RLIST) configuration
#                                     files (such as ugroute_elec.cfg.
#
#      UGII_FMBD_FORMATS_FILE         The file containing formats for
#                                     the Formboard annotation functions.
#
#      UGII_FMBD_USE_LAYOUTS          Switch that controls whether to
#                                     use a split screen layout to
#                                     display the harness and formboard
#                                     assemblies in Formboard Sync. If
#                                     TRUE then split screen is used.
#
#      UGII_FMBD_PATTERN_DIR          Directory that contains pattern
#                                     part files for use in Formboard
#                                     Frame Tool.
#
#      UGII_FMBD_CGM_DIR              Directory that contains CGM (.cgm)
#                                     files for use in Formboard Frame.
#
#      UGII_FMBD_DISABLE_ROTATION_VECTOR_ALIGNMENT          Switch that controls whether to
#                                                           use rotation vector defined on ports
#                                                           for orientation of components during
#                                                           create formboard layout.

#                                         port, which can significantly
#                                         improve the performance of the
#                                         Place Part operation.

# Routing doesn't support the use of load option revision rules such as "Precise",

# such as Place Part and Assign Stock to work with a "Precise" load option, the

# currently configured revision cannot be found.
# UGII_ROUTE_CONFIG_RULE="Latest Working"

# Uncomment the following variable to for NX to use the same bundling
# rules for cables that were used in NX2.  For NX2 the OD of the
