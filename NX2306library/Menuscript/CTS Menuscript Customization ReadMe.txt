Expression command:

CheckForSpreadsheet.dll - Checks for "Spreadsheet" attribute value set to "True", if yes, it produces a CTS Information message that says "Edit Model with Spreadsheet"



Stretch Curve command:

TurnUpdatesOff.dll - turns updates off at the beginning of stretch curve

TurnUpdatesOn.dll - turns updates on at the end of stretch curve

Starting with NX11, the stretch command will update with every apply move.  This fixes that problem.
